            <h2>High School</h2>
          &emsp; I am an aspiring Software engineer. My journey to becoming a Software engineer started long before I even realized it.
           As a kid, I enjoyed solving puzzles and problems. In middle school, I enjoyed math more than any other subject and I looked forward to it every day. 
           Before going to high school, I knew I wanted to pursue something that had to do with problem solving and math. My parents suggested that I should become an engineer.
            I was eager to learn and wanted to start right away. For me to do that, I need to go to a high school that had an engineering program.
             I chose to apply to a technical school called Passaic County Technical Institute and I applied to be in their engineering program. I got in.
          <br><br>
          &emsp;There my freshman engineering teacher started to challenge my perspective and ways of thinking. 
          It was hard but I enjoyed it. He also exposed my class to logical thinking by using Python. 
          He assigned us varying challenges to solve and I enjoyed them. 
          I fell in love with the challenge of trying to solve a problem by thinking in various ways. 
          This also sparked a passion for learning and reinforce my enjoyment of thinking and problem-solving. 
          Again, every day I looked forward to school and being able to challenge myself. 
          However, I never knew that Computer Science existed or that Software Engineering was a career option. 
          In the next 3 years of my high school career, I was given opportunities to program in RobotC for engineering class projects.
          In group projects, I would look for any opportunity to code the logic of the project.
          <br><br>
          <h2>College</h2>
          &emsp;I was able to study Computer Science at Rutgers. Although, I started off as an Electical/Computer Engineer, I ultimately switched over to Computer Science.
          Being at Rutgers gave my the opportunity to dive into many differnt CS topics , as well as allow me to refine and instill the fundamentals.
          <br><br>
          &emsp;As the semesters pass, the more and more I learn and the more I learn that there is still much to explore. I love learning, and I do not think I will ever stop learning. 
          This semesters I have chosen to take 2 classes under the scope of AI/ML as the topic really interests me very much. 
          <h2>Interests/Future Hopes</h2>
          I am interested in is AI/ML. I hope to either 
          <ul>
            <li>Continue my education with a focus in AI/ML</li>
            <li>Do research (either in academia or for a company) on AI/ML topics</li>
            <li>Take part in the application of AI/ML to interesting/unqiue problems</li>
          </ul>

                  <!-- &emsp;Rutgers Formula One Racing (RFR) is a club where students plan, design, and build a Formula One car to compete against other schools in multiple categories. 
                  Our car is being changed from being a combustion vehicle to an electric vehicle. The team has 8 sub-teams that work on different systems and have their own 
                  responsibilities. I am currently a member of 2 subteams. Which are the Data Acquisition/Suspension team and the Electronics/Electric Powertrain team.
                  <br><br>
                  &emsp;Along with my love for programming, I have also had an admiration for cars. Being on the RFR team allows me to indulge in both. 
                  I can develop my skills and get team experience in programming while being able to work on a car. Although I am a new member, I wish to learn as much as
                  I can from my seniors and put in as much effort as I can in order to help the team.

                  <h5>Reading </h5>
                  <p>
                  &emsp;I believe that reading is one of the best ways a person can sharpen their mind. 
                  Reading is a great way of obtaining knowledge and gaining perspective on multiple topics. 
                  I like to read consistently and I believe that reading is a great way to spend my free time. 
                  </p>
                  <h5>Lifting and Exercise</h5>
                  <p>
                  &emsp;I like to allocate time to exercise. I believe that exercising is good for bettering my mental health and allows me to grow in different ways both physically and mentally. 
                  My most consistent method of exercise is lifting and calisthenics.  
                  Other than that, I prefer to bike to class because it is very efficient. I gain a form of transportation and I also can save time by not waiting for a bus. 
                  Also, I play team sports with friends such as volleyball and soccer which allows me to refine my communication and team skills.
                  These physical activities allow my body to stay healthy and also have benefits for my mind and mental health.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Non-STEM Extracurricular Study </h5>
                  <p>
                  &emsp;There are many different fields of study out there. 
                  Although such things don't directly affect one's skills as a software engineer, having knowledge in other fields can allow for 
                  new things to be created, new ideas to be formed, and different perspectives of approaching ideas. Spending time to study other things can indirectly make 
                  for a better engineer but also  more importantly a better person overall. Furthermore, I spend time looking into different topics mostly because its fun and interesting. Some of the things I like to spend my free time studying are:
                  <br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Philosophy</li>
                    <li>Psychology</li>
                    <li>Writing</li>
                  </ul>
 
                  </p>
                  <!-- <h5>Meditation and Self-Improvement</h5>
                  <p>
                  &emsp;Though not as concrete as my other hobbies, I actively try to meditate and improve myself. 
                  I would not necessarily label this as a “hobby”, it is more like a lifestyle but I felt it is important to mention. 
                  I believe that constant reflection and allocating time to think is important. 
                  I think that constant growth is important and I constantly want to be a better version of myself regardless of category. 
                  Growing my mindset, perspective, and knowledge is very important to me. I like to force myself to complete challenging tasks to make myself grow. 
                  Learning is important to me, I constantly yearn to learn new things and refine my knowledge on topics I already know.
                  </p> -->
                  <h5>Music</h5>
                  <p>
                  &emsp;I spend time learning/studying music for my own joy.
                   I play guitar/piano in my free time for small amounts of time.
                    Hearing is an important sense that I am lucky enough to have. I want to be able to understand the beauty in the sounds I hear and be able to recreate them.
