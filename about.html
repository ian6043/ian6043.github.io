          &emsp; I am an aspiring Software engineer. My journey to becoming a Software engineer started long before I even realized it.
           As a kid, I enjoyed solving puzzles and problems. In middle school, I enjoyed math more than any other subject and I looked forward to it every day. 
           Before going to high school, I knew I wanted to pursue something that had to do with problem solving and math. My parents suggested that I should become an engineer.
            I was eager to learn and wanted to start right away. For me to do that, I need to go to a high school that had an engineering program.
             I chose to apply to a technical school called Passaic County Technical Institute and I applied to be in their engineering program. I got in.
          <br><br>
          &emsp;There my freshman engineering teacher started to challenge my perspective and ways of thinking. 
          It was hard but I enjoyed it. He also exposed my class to logical thinking by using Python. 
          He assigned us varying challenges to solve and I enjoyed them. 
          I fell in love with the challenge of trying to solve a problem by thinking in various ways. 
          This also sparked a passion for learning and reinforce my enjoyment of thinking and problem-solving. 
          Again, every day I looked forward to school and being able to challenge myself. 
          However, I never knew that Computer Science existed or that Software Engineering was a career option. 
          In the next 3 years of my high school career, I was given opportunities to program in RobotC for engineering class projects.
          In group projects, I would look for any opportunity to code the logic of the project.
          <br><br>
          &emsp;During my first semester at Rutgers, I started to look into different engineering career options. 
          I found out what Software Engineering was and that it was a viable career choice. 
          It was a little late to realize but I knew that is what I wanted to pursue. 
          I then looked into what I would need to do to learn the topics essential to it. 
          I then took Introduction to Computer Science in the Spring of 2021 and then Introduction to Data Structures in the summer. 
          In the summer I learned how vast Computer Science and Software Engineering was. The sheer amount of different topics made me curious and hungry to learn more. 
          I started learning Front-End, I learned HTML and CSS, then I learned a bit of Javascript, then I started working with React.Js and enhanced my Javascript. 
          I made a sorting algorithm visualizer as a challenge to my new skills and knowledge and to reinforce the topics I learned in class.
          <br><br>
          &emsp;I have taken more CS courses since then and I have been learning as much as I can. 
          I wish to continue learning, practicing my skills, and challenging my mind. 
          Learning and challenges excite me and I enjoy enhancing my knowledge and developing myself.
           Regardless of the challenges along the way, I will continue my journey toward being a Software Engineer.

                  <!-- &emsp;Rutgers Formula One Racing (RFR) is a club where students plan, design, and build a Formula One car to compete against other schools in multiple categories. 
                  Our car is being changed from being a combustion vehicle to an electric vehicle. The team has 8 sub-teams that work on different systems and have their own 
                  responsibilities. I am currently a member of 2 subteams. Which are the Data Acquisition/Suspension team and the Electronics/Electric Powertrain team.
                  <br><br>
                  &emsp;Along with my love for programming, I have also had an admiration for cars. Being on the RFR team allows me to indulge in both. 
                  I can develop my skills and get team experience in programming while being able to work on a car. Although I am a new member, I wish to learn as much as
                  I can from my seniors and put in as much effort as I can in order to help the team.

                  <h5>Reading </h5>
                  <p>
                  &emsp;I believe that reading is one of the best ways a person can sharpen their mind. 
                  Reading is a great way of obtaining knowledge and gaining perspective on multiple topics. 
                  I like to read consistently and I believe that reading is a great way to spend my free time. 
                  </p>
                  <h5>Lifting and Exercise</h5>
                  <p>
                  &emsp;I like to allocate time to exercise. I believe that exercising is good for bettering my mental health and allows me to grow in different ways both physically and mentally. 
                  My most consistent method of exercise is lifting and calisthenics. I wake up early in the morning and do either of the two every weekday. 
                  Other than that, I prefer to bike to class because it is very efficient. I gain a form of transportation and I also can save time by not waiting for a bus. 
                  Also, I play team sports with friends such as volleyball and soccer which allows me to refine my communication and team skills.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Studying Philosophy </h5>
                  <p>
                  &emsp;Although I am not learning through a structured class, I enjoy studying philosophy. 
                  I think studying philosophy and reading works of the past is very important. 
                  Philosophy challenges the way I think and forces me to try and understand things from multiple perspectives. 
                  It also provides me the knowledge to help better myself, my mindset, and my perspective
                  </p>
                  <h5>Meditation and Self-Improvement</h5>
                  <p>
                  &emsp;Though not as concrete as my other hobbies, I actively try to meditate and improve myself. 
                  I would not necessarily label this as a “hobby”, it is more like a lifestyle but I felt it is important to mention. 
                  I believe that constant reflection and allocating time to think is important. 
                  I think that constant growth is important and I constantly want to be a better version of myself regardless of category. 
                  Growing my mindset, perspective, and knowledge is very important to me. I like to force myself to complete challenging tasks to make myself grow. 
                  Learning is important to me, I constantly yearn to learn new things and refine my knowledge on topics I already know.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Piano</h5>
                  <p>
                  &emsp;I have recently started learning to play the piano.
                   I play in my free time, on the weekends, or during vacation.
                    I enjoy listening to piano music when I do homework so I wanted to learn how to create the same beautiful sounds I hear.
